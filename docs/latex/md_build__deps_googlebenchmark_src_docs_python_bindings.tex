Python bindings are available as wheels on \href{https://pypi.org/project/google-benchmark/}{\texttt{ Py\+PI}} for importing and using Google Benchmark directly in Python. Currently, pre-\/built wheels exist for mac\+OS (both ARM64 and Intel x86), Linux x86-\/64 and 64-\/bit Windows. Supported Python versions are Python 3.\+7 -\/ 3.\+10.

To install Google Benchmark\textquotesingle{}s Python bindings, run\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{python -\/m pip install -\/-\/upgrade pip  \# for manylinux2014 support}
\DoxyCodeLine{python -\/m pip install google-\/benchmark}

\end{DoxyCode}


In order to keep your system Python interpreter clean, it is advisable to run these commands in a virtual environment. See the \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html}{\texttt{ official Python documentation}} on how to create virtual environments.

To build a wheel directly from source, you can follow these steps\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/google/benchmark.git}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd benchmark}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# create a virtual environment and activate it}
\DoxyCodeLine{python3 -\/m venv venv -\/-\/system-\/site-\/packages}
\DoxyCodeLine{source venv/bin/activate  \# .\(\backslash\)venv\(\backslash\)Scripts\(\backslash\)Activate.ps1 on Windows}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# upgrade Python's system-\/wide packages}
\DoxyCodeLine{python -\/m pip install -\/-\/upgrade pip setuptools wheel}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# builds the wheel and stores it in the directory "{}wheelhouse"{}.}
\DoxyCodeLine{python -\/m pip wheel . -\/w wheelhouse}

\end{DoxyCode}


NB\+: Building wheels from source requires Bazel. For platform-\/specific instructions on how to install Bazel, refer to the \href{https://bazel.build/install}{\texttt{ Bazel installation docs}}.
